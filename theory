CCS is short for cascading style sheets.

CSS lets us create default settings & formats and apply them to parts of our page. It's a bit like having formatting subroutines that you can call at any time.

The syntax to connect an external CSS file to a HTML document is the following:

<html>

<head>
  <title>title</title>
  <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
</head>

Let's break it down:

- <link>: This is an HTML tag used to link external resources to a webpage.
- href="style.css": This attribute specifies the path to the external CSS file. In this case, it's named "style.css" and is located in the same directory as the HTML file.
- rel="stylesheet": This attribute defines the relationship between the linked document and the current document. In this case, it indicates that the linked document is a stylesheet.
- type="text/css": This attribute specifies the type of the linked document. In this case, it specifies that the document is a CSS file.

CSS SYNTAX

The syntax for CSS code is the following:

html tag {
  attribute: value;
  attribute: value;
}

When writing CSS, you have to take into account the following things:

The curly braces are important - they surround the style for each tag.
Each line should finish with a semi colon - or it won't work.
Font family lets you pick a particular font or general style for your text. 
  It's generally good practice to use general style rather than specify one font, 
  because the one you pick might not be supported by all web browsers. 
  You can find some web-safe fonts here: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.php

COMMENTING

To leave comments in your CSS code, place your plain text inside /* */ marks.

/* This code affects the entire HTML and body parts of the html file */
html, body {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%; 
}

ASSIGN A STYLE TO MULTIPLE TAGS

To assign the same style to multiple tags, just use a comma when listing the tags it will affect:

h1, h2{
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 24px;
  color: blue;
  background-color: #d3d345;
  text-align:center;
    
}

If I want to be one or more values to be different in one of the tags, I can just specify it later:

h2{
  font-size: 12px;
  
}

This second style for <h2> works a bit like sub-classes did in OOP. It inherits all the properties from the first style and then 
  applies the new settings as well, prioritizing the settings in the second style if there is a conflict.

BODY SIZE

You can set the size of the body of the HTML document like this:

body {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
}

HEADING STYLE

The following script is an example of how to choose the style of a heading.

h1{
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 24px;
  color: blue;
  background-color: #d3d345;
}

PARAGRAPH STYLE

p{
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 10px;
  color: blue;    
}

BACKGROUND COLOR

html, body {
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #FF0000; /* Sets the background color to red */
}

ALIGNMENT

h1{
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-size: 24px;
  color: blue;
  background-color: #d3d345;
  text-align:center;
    
}

IMAGES

We can also use CSS with our image tags. Centering an image isn't very intuitive, but we can do it like this:

img{
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 50%;
  
}
